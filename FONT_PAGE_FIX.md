# /font Page Redirect Fix

## Issue
Clicking `/font` in header redirects to homepage instead of showing the font listing page.

## Verified
- ✅ `/font/page.tsx` exists and is correct
- ✅ Shows 1000+ fonts in grid layout
- ✅ All routes are properly configured

## Solution

### Quick Fix:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

### If Still Not Working:

Check the Header link is correct:
```tsx
<Link href="/font" className="...">
  All Fonts
</Link>
```

The page at `app/font/page.tsx` should load and display all 1000+ fonts.

## What the /font Page Shows
- Grid of 1000+ font generators
- Each font is clickable
- Links to individual font pages at `/font/[slug]`
- Responsive grid layout (2-5 columns based on screen size)

---
**Status**: Page exists and is configured correctly. Try clearing cache and restarting dev server.
